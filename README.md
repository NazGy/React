# Welcome to my website!

A simple React based website to demonstrate my skills, experience and contact info.

## Deploying

```npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"```


## Future Goals

- Host data in server instead of on front end
- Add smooth transitions between page navigation
